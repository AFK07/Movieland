# Movieland

A demonstrative web application where I am learning React and the basics of using API. I used omdbapi to fetch movie data and display it on the page. However, the movie details and itself are not present as this is only a demonstration to learn React. 

# Features

The search bar is the initial feature of the GUI. The user can view the movie poster if their cursor hovers over it. Both desktop and mobile are compatible.

# Getting Started

Node.js and npm should be installed.
